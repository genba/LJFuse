h3. Running

p. Plug in a U3, U6, or UE9 and run:

$ python ljfuse.py

p. On Mac OS X, it will print

$ python ljfuse.py
Making directory root-ljfuse for LJFuse
Mounting LJFuse at root-ljfuse.
When done, eject it from the Finder or run `umount LJFuse' (without quotes).
$

p. On Linux, it will print

$ python ljfuse.py 
Making directory root-ljfuse for LJFuse
Mounting LJFuse at root-ljfuse.
Unmount it with `fusermount -u root-ljfuse' (without quotes).

In either case, change to the `root-ljfuse' directory and look around. There
are `README.txt' files in every subdirectory with context-specific help.
