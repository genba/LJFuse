h3. Requirements

* A U3, U6, or UE9 over USB with the latest firmware. The U3 requires 1.26; the U6 requires 1.15; and the UE9 requires control firmware 2.13 and comm firmware 1.5.
* "LabJackPython":http://github.com/labjack/LabJackPython
* "Exodriver":http://github.com/labjack/exodriver
* On Mac OS X, LJFuse requires "MacFUSE":http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/. On Linux, LJFuse uses the kernel's fuse implementation.

h3. Running

p. Plug in a U3, U6, or UE9 and run:

<pre>
  <code>
$ python ljfuse.py
  </code>
</pre>

p. On Mac OS X, it will print

<pre>
  <code>
$ python ljfuse.py
Making directory root-ljfuse for LJFuse
Mounting LJFuse at root-ljfuse.
When done, eject it from the Finder or run `umount LJFuse' (without quotes).
$
  </code>
</pre>

p. On Linux, it will print

<pre>
  <code>
$ python ljfuse.py 
Making directory root-ljfuse for LJFuse
Mounting LJFuse at root-ljfuse.
Unmount it with `fusermount -u root-ljfuse' (without quotes).
$
  </code>
</pre>

In either case, change to the `root-ljfuse' directory and look around. There are `README.txt' files in every subdirectory with context-specific help.

<pre>
  <code>
$ cd root-ljfuse/
$ ls
HOW_TO_UNMOUNT.txt  My U6/     README.txt
  </code>
</pre>

h3. Credits

p. LJFuse is built using "fusepy":http://code.google.com/p/fusepy/. It's simple and doesn't get in your way. MacFUSE on Mac OS X makes it easy to set the volume name and icon of the filesystem.
